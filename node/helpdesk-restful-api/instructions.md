# Helpdesk Ticketing System
This code challenge is about implementing the Back-end solution for a Helpdesk ticketing system, where users can create, edit and delete tickets for IT to solve. 

## Main tasks:
1. Create a Database of your preference to manage tickets (unique ticket number, title, description, user, status...)
2. Write a REST API using Node.js that has enough endpoints to allow to:
  - Get the list of all tickets
  - Get a specific ticket
  - Create a new ticket
  - Update a specific ticket
  - Delete a specific ticket
3. On the  "Get the list of all tickets" service, add functionality to allow for filtering/sorting/paging the list of tickets.
5. Push the code to a private github repo with a README.md that explains how to run and access the API.



## Bonus points
1. Generate documentation for the API.
2. Error handling.
3. Dockerize the app.
4. Write realistic tests.
5. Use of Typescript.
