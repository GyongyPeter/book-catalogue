# Helpdesk Ticketing System
This code challenge is about implementing a Helpdesk ticketing system, where users can create, edit and delete tickets for IT to solve. 

## Main tasks:
1. Create a Database of your preference to manage tickets (unique ticket number, title, description, user, status, comments...)
2. Write a REST API using Node.js that has enough endpoints to allow to:
  - Get the list of all tickets
  - Get a specific ticket
  - Create a new ticket
  - Update a specific ticket
  - Delete a specific ticket
3. On the  "Get the list of all tickets" service, add functionality to allow for filtering/sorting/paging the list of tickets.
4. Develop a React app Front-end solution that allows users to 
  - Display an initial list with all tickets, allowing Filtering/sorting/paging.
  - When a ticket from the list is clicked, it should render a ticket detail view on a separate page displaying the the specific information of that ticket
  - Create a new ticket
  - Delete a specific ticket
  - Update a ticket
  - Make it look decent. No need for super sophisticated design, but at a minimum, make it responsive so that it looks good on a mobile phone. 
  - No users management and authentication is needed. 
5. Push the code to a private github repo with a README.md that explains how to run API & Frontend app 



## Bonus points
1. Generate documentation for the API.
2. Error handling.
3. Dockerize the app.
4. Write realistic tests.
5. Use of Typescript.
